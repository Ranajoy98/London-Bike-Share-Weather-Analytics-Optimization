# London Bike Sharing Analysis

This project explores the factors influencing bike-sharing trends in London, focusing on the impact of weather conditions and time patterns. Using Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, the project uncovers key insights into bike rentals and trends over time.

## Features

1. **Correlation Analysis**: 
   - Analyzed relationships between weather conditions (temperature, humidity), time of day, and bike rentals.

2. **Interactive Dashboards**:
   - Designed Tableau dashboards to visualize the impact of weather and time on bike-sharing demand.
   - Included filters and interactive elements for dynamic exploration of the dataset.

3. **Trend Identification**:
   - Utilized moving averages to highlight uptrends and downtrends in bike-sharing patterns.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard creation.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for exploratory analysis).

## Installation

### Python Environment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd london-bike-sharing-analysis
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### Tableau
1. Install Tableau Desktop (if not already installed).
2. Open the provided `.twb` Tableau workbook file to explore the dashboards.

## Usage
1. Use Python scripts to preprocess and analyze the dataset:
   - Clean and transform the data.
   - Perform correlation analysis.
   - Calculate moving averages.

2. Open the Tableau workbook to:
   - Explore interactive dashboards.
   - Visualize trends and correlations between weather, time, and bike rentals.

## Insights
- Significant correlations exist between weather conditions and bike-sharing demand.
- Peak bike rentals occur at specific times of the day, influenced by weather and commuting patterns.
- Moving averages reveal long-term trends in bike-sharing activity.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes information on weather conditions, timestamps, and bike rental counts.
